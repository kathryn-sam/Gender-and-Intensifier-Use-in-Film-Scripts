One man.  He must be good. You underestimate the trap, Mary. What's the point? Where? Pris? I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary? Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate. He knows what he's doing. Well stocked. We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost. Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along... Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for. I've done some questionable things. I am? But not to last. Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells. What about E.M.S. recombination? Why? I want more life, fucker. Death. Had in mind something a little more radical. Can the maker repair what he makes? It's not an easy thing to meet your maker. Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home. The name is Batty.  Roy Batty. No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together. Just thought I'd... Where are you going, Sebastian? Thank you. You're our best and only friend. This afternoon. When do you deliver your project? No. Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to. I'd be happy to mention it to him. His company made us. He could? Tyrell could help us, Sebastian. He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then. Dr. Tyrell? What about your friend, the man who owns this building? If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league. You could help us. Of course not. Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet. You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there? We have a lot in common. Like... Like what? Show me something? Nexus - 6. What generation are you? You're androids. What, Sebastian? You're just all so... so different. Why are you staring at us? Well, actually Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to. If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be... How about breakfast, I was just going to make some. Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor. I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you? Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece. Very good, Pris.  Now show him why. Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home? Hello, glad to meet you. When? What's going on down there? Yeah.  I got it. Got it. Who. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't like her. She was gonna get away. I was just about to have my dinner. Yeah. Garbage man? What was the cover on the one that got Holden? Where do we start? You got a machine on it yet? What was he after? Six, huh? Day after tomorrow. Soon as I finish the job. It's gotta be right for my customer. Number three. Next. Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females. Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge? The umbrella. Not if it works. Yes? I think we're through for the night. I know all that. Okay, but... How do I stop one? You start. You equipped for random questions? Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot. Four years. I don't know. I gotta piss. I like you too. No thanks. Prosit. How long you had these guys? Those cockroaches? Sorry, don't have the time. Prosit. My pleasure. Shot of vodka, please. I'll but you one.  What'll you have? It's okay.  Forget it. These aren't just... What's that? I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes. No.  I got a problem. Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I'm doing okay. Sorry. Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled. Me too. But if you could? Why didn't you go? Never been more sure of anything in my life. They'll change the limit before I change my mind. Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there. Nope. True. Huh huh. Yeah? Meaning? No rust? What shows? Book the good ones for where? You talking about the Opera House on the Main? What's suck night? What night? The girl that doesn't look like that girl. What did she want? Do you recognize any of them? I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures. Can I come in? Taffey Lewis? Me. Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress. You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body. Sorry. Does it eat? It's a good job. It that mother real? For holes. Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could. Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person? You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way? There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place. I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists... What? Just wait here. Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone. No, I don't. Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it. Because it's not. Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long. What's a long time? You mean a woman? I never felt better. Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education. I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect. Never mind the plug, just go through the motions. I don't like people snooping around my stuff. Don't be fooled by appearances. Hmmm? Like? What? It wasn't very good last night, was it? Yeah. Yeah.  Sometimes. If they are smart, they take naps. Not too good. I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out. Dead. Me and my dad. You did? You ever take a bath with a man before? Sit. Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite. Right. I can imagine. Yeah. So? I work alone. Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no. I've already got more help than I need. Is there anything else? Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters. Sounds like you speaks from experience. In your opinion. Why not? You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion. You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug. In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl. You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist. You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar. Why should I be? It's artificial? A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem. I'll see you in a minute. Bad? What's up? You know where I been.  I been on vacation. Discreetly. Five, maybe six. She didn't know? Thirteen. If she is, the machine works. One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject? Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof. No. Go ahead. Yes. Please. Thanks. You're all so perfect. I keep a lot of provisions right here. Good. Ah, you get hold of your friends? Yes.  I couldn't pass the test. My glands.  They grow old too fast. Methuselah Syndrome. Twenty. Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now... Beautiful. You look... better. You scared me. I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place? We sure did. What about friends? Where are your folks? Oh. You want to go home? Mine's J.F. Sebastian. What's your name? How come you were in my truck?\",\n          \"Buzz?  What are we doing this for? Yeah. Sure.  It's fine. Hi. Jim Stark. Stay there. Where can we meet? You satisfied or you want more? Machismo? I thought only punks fought with knives. Chicken? Meaning me? I'm cute, too. You watch too much television. You know something? And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear. He depended on me. You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom? Son--this is all happening so fast-- I don't want to learn that! You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim. No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off? You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it? You don't want me to go. Will you wait a minute? Except yourself! Well-- I don't think so-- You what? Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight? You're absolutely right! That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another. Well, just get it off your chest, son. She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care! Will you let him tell it! I was in it. Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V. I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction? Go ahead. I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important-- Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now! You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again. Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad? Well, now-- What can you do when you have to be a man? We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice-- We don't have time. Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons-- The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now? How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in? Blood. I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject. What would you do, Dad? Is there some kind of trick answer? Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it? Shoot, Jimbo. Hey--I want to ask you something. I'm not hungry. Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say? Yes. You awake? I better clean this up before she sees it. That's funny! Yeah!  Shh! And you dropped it? It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper. Yeah! You thought I was Mom? And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you-- Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here. So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to! My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess-- You make any sandwiches? Mother-- Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we? You buy me many things.  Thank you. You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car-- You can't protect me. Hold it, Jim. Tell him why we moved here. I think I know my son. You sure? No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark. Go on--Give 'em to your friends. No thanks, I don't smoke. Have some cigars. Luck, Jim.  Don't forget. Sure.  Sure. Excuse us a minute? What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself? Sorry. Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but-- Say, listen-- He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink. No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa-- You don't? I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink. Stay here.  That was my son! No, honey.  No, he's not here. Who's there?  Anyone there? See?  It stopped. Look--just relax, will you? He's home.  I heard the car. What's that pounding? I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out! Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's-- Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything? Just relax, please relax! Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids. Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and-- He's just loaded, honey. Listen--can't you wait till we get home? I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too. Head-shrinker? In my mother's drawer. I don't know.  End up in the electric chair? No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good? Plato. I'll wait for him. My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here. I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important. Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name-- Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore! Plato! Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back? Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away. But you didn't hurt anybody. I shot at one of them. Just a guard. Who's that? Come on! They like you.  Okay? Why? Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out. You promised to give it back. You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second. I need it. In your pocket.  Give it to me. My gun? You want to give me your gun now, Plato? What do you think? Can I keep it? I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm. No. Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now? You sure? We didn't run out.  We were coming right back. I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me? Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you. Here. I just have a feeling.  Where are you? Why? No.  At dawn. You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim? I'm fine. That's swell.  How are you? I know.  Light a match, will you? I've got a gun. Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you? I'm here. Plato? Get away from me! You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut! Your father! I don't want you for my father! Plato! What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for? You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday. Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight. Who? When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back. When was that? I came here before. I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead. How do you know so much about this junk, Plato? Not lately. Haven't you noticed your personality splitting? Hey!  How 'bout that! Isn't he schizoid? I'm what?  What? Man, you're schizoid! Let's see how long we can stay under. Come on! We'll take it! There's only one key. What? It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery? Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another. Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer. Isn't it crazy? Wow!  Well now-there-then! We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think? No.  I'm scared. Shut up.  Are you nuts? Come out come out wherever you are! I'm here.  Shut up. Hey where'd you go? Help me in! Judy. They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there? We know. Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you. Yeah? They're looking for you!-- How'd you find me?  What's happening? It's me! Who's that! Jim! Yeah. O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow. Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off... If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could... Who has? Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to. I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what? No.  It's okay. My personality's showing again. Should I leave? Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging. I hitched. How'd you get here? What's a chickie-run? What? Who knows.  Plato? Are you really going to meet them? No.  In the morning. Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night? They're still there! I'm here. Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go! No.  It's perpetual motion. I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops? He has a knife. I just don't want trouble. You scared? I know.  That's why I came back. Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you. Plato.  It's a nickname. Jim.  What's yours? What's your name! I don't want to make friends. He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them. What? You shouldn't monkey with him. Once you been up there, you know you been some place! What? Boy! I'm sorry--I made a mistake. No.  I don't think so-- You remember me? Hi there. Hi. Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me? You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad? No!  You're not tearing me loose any more. Just tell a little white lie? But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen! What's that got to do with it? I can't keep it to myself anymore-- I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed. Mom--I'm not-- It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car-- I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer. 'Bye, Mom. It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something-- I'm sorry. Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back-- You serious? Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now? Okay-- Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks. Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place. You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water? How can anyone grow up in this circus? I bet you see right through me, don't you? Chicken? I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him. \\\"If he could\\\" what?  You mean your father? If he could-- Pretty mixed up? A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die. What? What a zoo! She eats him alive and he takes it. Things pretty tough for you at home? But you don't think that's a solution. They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine. So then you moved? They never do. And your folks didn't understand? He called me chicken. Mess that kid up? You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it? And they think they are protecting my by moving. That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check. Try the desk. All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it. You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now? I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out. Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks? I don't know why--! No. Leave me alone. Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why? No. Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it? Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots? Wash up and go home. Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you. Get lost. Grandma? Someone should put poison in her epsom salts. Plato! Listen-- Yes, ma'am. Want me to imitate a stupid cop? Sure.  He was trying to make us his family. He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us. No!  I got to find him. No! It is for me too. It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me. So do you. What? You disappointed? What a relief! There's something I should tell you, Judy. Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets-- Maybe he's scared of the dark. Why? What? Hi. Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest? Should we explore? How many rooms do you think there are? Ever been in a place like this before? I bet you hear everything I say! Of course.  Drown them like puppies. Well--we're newlyweds. Why don't we just rent it for the season? No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear? You can trust me, Judy. Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me? Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo. Where you going? I felt like it. Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time. Sure.  Lots of times. I'm getting that way, too. I don't think you trust anybody, do you? Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything. Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing. Every day I look in the mirror and say, \\\"What?  You still here?\\\" Man! No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb? I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again. You cold? You still pretty upset? I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so. You were looking for me, weren't you? They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself? I'm not so bad. A what? Oh. Yeah.  So where's the high school? Yeah--why-- Where's Dawson High School? You're really flipped--aren't you. See, I'm new. Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here? \\\"Life can be beautiful.\\\" Hey, I know where it was. See? You don't have to be unfriendly. Hi.  I saw you before. Hi. I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference? He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York! Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them. Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree? Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month! Okay. Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him \\\"Jamie.\\\" Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere. Yes.  My best friend. Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy. She's being called for. Your mother will be down in a few minutes. Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy-- Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents? Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy. Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that? Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that? You weren't looking for company, were you? Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning? That one? Do you think your father means that? He makes you feel pretty unhappy? What makes you think he hates you, Judy? What? Judy--we're ready for you now.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
